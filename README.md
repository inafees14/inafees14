# Hi there, I'm Mohammad Nafees Iqbal! 👋

I'm a passionate **Data Science** student pursuing my Master's at Aligarh Muslim University, with a strong foundation in Statistics from my Bachelor's degree. I love exploring machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics to solve real-world problems. When I'm not diving into data, you'll find me experimenting with the latest tech trends and sharing insights online.
